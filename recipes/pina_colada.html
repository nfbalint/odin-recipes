    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>The Piña Colada has a bit of a bad rap among cocktail connoisseurs. For years, this now-classic drink was the poster child of the blender boom, a symbol of poolside bars and booze cruises. But the tropical cocktail—a mix of rum, coconut, pineapple and lime juices—dates to the 1950s and has been satisfying vacationers and Tiki aficionados since.</p>

        <li>15ml freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>Garnish: pineapple wedge</li>
