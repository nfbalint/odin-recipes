    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>Gin & Tonic. If you can say it, you can make it. Right? Right. But also, not exactly. The two-ingredient cocktail requires your undivided attention. From glassware to garnish to style of gin and spirit proof, everything should be carefully considered when mixing a G&T.</p>
    <p>A Gin & Tonic made with a potent base—45% ABV and above, if you mean business—and configured with two parts tonic to one part gin is a highball of balance and beauty. Too much gin, and the botanical spirit will overshadow the unique qualities of the tonic. Too much tonic, and it will drown the gin.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>60ml gin</li>
        <li>120ml tonic water</li>
        <li>Garnish: 2 lime wheels or other seasonal garnishes you may prefer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a highball glass with ice, then add the gin.</li>
        <li>Top with the tonic water and gently stir.</li>
        <li>Garnish with lime wheels or seasonal garnishes</li>
    </ol>
