While there are variations on the Cuba Libre’s origin story, the dominant narrative attributes the drink to a U.S. Army captain living in Havana after being stationed there for the war. One day, while celebrating Cuba’s victory at a local bar, the captain added Coca-Cola and a little lime juice to his Bacardí rum and toasted his Cuban comrades by exclaiming, “Por Cuba Libre!” (“To a free Cuba!”), which was the slogan of the Cuban independence movement. The drink—and the name—stuck.</p>
